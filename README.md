# zomato_restaurants_analysis
The original dataset comes from Kaggle (scraped from Zomato), containing all restaurants in Bangalore until 15 March 2019.
The raw data has 51718 rows and 17 columns. I do the data cleaning using python, and the cleaned data with 31159 rows and 9 columns is stored in 'cleaned.csv'. It could be visualized in the Tableau workbook 'zomato.twb'. In 'rate_and_cost.ipynb', I built a linear relation model between 'rate' and 'cost'.
